qbf2epr is a tool for translating QBF formulas in QDIMACS format to 
various other formalisms like first-order, EPR, second-order

The following options are supported:
 
usage: main.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            	show this help message and exit
  -i FILE, --infile=FILE	qdimacs input FILE
  -o FILE, --outfile=FILE	output FILE
  -t TYPE, --type=TYPE  	transformation type: [q,e,f,c,s]  	
				[q] 	print QBF as it is
				[e]	print EPR with prefix
				[f]	print first-order
                        	[c]	print EPR in CNF
				[s] 	print second-order
				[d]	print EPR under standard dependency scheme
  -f, --disable-formatcheck
  -q, --quiet          

Note: The -t d options uses the standard dependency scheme 
implemented in the QBF solver DepQBF (fmv.jku.at/depqbf).
For using option -t d, the depService binary has to be in the path.
The depService binary is available in the service subfolder
